	In principle, a Cello user just has to specify available genetic parts (e.g., sensors and transcription factors), design constraints (e.g., what organism the circuit will be used in), and the desired logic truth table (mapping inputs to outputs). After stochastically searching for a combination of parts that should work, Cello composes a DNA sequence that can be synthesized and put into cells for testing.
